                I've worked on a number of projects both for course projects and personal challenges.

                Adventure-2
            </h3>
            <p>
                I built the first iteration of my text-based sandbox adventure game in Python as a personal project to develop my skills and practice good programming paradigms. The second
                iteration is a complete rebuilding of the first, built in C++. <br/>
                Though still in development, the game's basics are playable, and developed modularly to allow easy porting to different operating systems or even a web-based version.
